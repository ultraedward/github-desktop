                <ul class="list-style">
                    <h4>What are the main reasons I could benefit from Dark Blue LLC?</h4>
                            <li>Zero Investment – 100% Profit: The first thing most businesses consider in any decision is the associated cost, so you’ll be pleased to know that we do not require any payment of any kind and will never ask a business owner for a single cent for any of our standard services. That means that it will never cost a business owner money to have an Dark Blue ATM set up and operate at any location. Businesses that use Dark Blue LLC get a profit share starting at 25% per transaction and increasing from there, depending on the level of traffic your business location generates. Unlike most ATM companies, who have a static profit share that does not take into account the traffic of your location, we reward businesses that have a greater level of traffic with a higher profit share rate.</li>


                            <li>Increase Traffic to Your Business or Location: We have a focus on the “internet of things” and social media to generate business. We use a wide variety of advertising platforms at our expense to drive customers to our ATM machines, which, in turn, will drive customers to your business. For instance, using Google Maps, we set up a location for each ATM machine which helps customers locate our machines. This means that people (with cash!) are going to be coming to YOUR business who would not otherwise do so, increasing your company’s local awareness and customer base. In addition, we use avenues such as Facebook, YouTube and many more to promote our Dark Blue ATMs. This drives even MORE traffic to your business.</li>

                            <li>Complimentary Receipt Couponing: ATM receipts with coupons can not only pay back a customer’s surcharge with savings on products you carry, they’re also a great way to drive sales! This service creates a truly synergistic relationship between our ATM and your business. For every receipt that prints out we allow your business to advertise promotions, special events and more. This generates more on-site business for your establishment, rewards the use of our ATMs which drives customers back to your business, and creates greater customer awareness and loyalty at your business.</li>

                            <li>Expert Service: Our ATM machines are serviced and loaded by trained professionals that inspect each ATM on a regular basis to ensure perfect function and constantly available funds. This guarantees that not only the new customers you will receive from operating a Dark Blue ATM always have access to cash, but that our business represents your business in only the most professional fashion.</li>

                    <h4>Are there any monthly charges or hidden monthly fees for my new ATM?</h4>

                            <li>Absolutely not. All aspects of Dark Blue basic services are provided absolutely free of charge. There is no charge for setting up, operating or advertising with any ATM machines on any businesses property.</li>

                    <h4>How do I load my ATM?</h4>

                            <li>Any business that has an Dark Blue ATM will not be expected to handle the process of loading any ATM. Each Dark Blue ATM is loaded by a trained professional on a regular basis. This saves you the time and hassle of guaranteeing your machine has available funds. We also have another plan for those businesses that they want to load the DARK Blue ATM machines by themselves.</li>

                    <h4>How much revenue can I expect to generate from an ATM placement?</h4>

                            <li>The Profit Margin on setting up an Dark Blue ATM is 100%. Since there is no cost to set up an Dark Blue ATM, any business that has one of our machines on their premises can expect pure profit with zero investment.</li>

                            <li>The Raw Numbers are pretty concrete. Statistically, if an ATM is located inside of a business, the number of customers that enter that business in a day is the number of transactions that can be expected per month. This means if 150 customers enter your business in a day and each transaction is $3.00, after the network fee we pay, you can expect to make nearly $2,000 annually with our starting 25% rate. If an ATM is placed outside of your business, the amount of money you make annually can rise exponentially depending on the location of your establishment and where outside of your business the ATM is placed.</li>

                <h4>How secure are ATM Machines from robbery – Is my business safe?</h4>

                            <li>The Likelihood of an ATM crime occurring is very small. According to the POP Center (Problem Oriented Policing – www.popcenter.com), estimates for the percentage of ATM crimes are derived from periodic surveys of banks conducted by banking associations. According to those surveys, there was an estimated one ATM crime (including robbery) per 3.5 million transactions. This means that there is a 0.00000286% chance of an ATM crime occurring at any given location in the United States.</li>

                <h4>Whose is responsible for machine repairs and regular maintenance?</h4>

                            <li>Dark Blue LLC handles all maintenance and repairs to our machines at absolutely no cost to the business or location owner. We use only the most professional service providers when doing so. We keep our machines clean and attractive, because we know how important presentation is to your business, and ours.</li>

                <h4>What are the requirements to qualify for free ATM machine placement?</h4>

                            <li>Qualifying for one of our ATM machines to be placed at your location is very simple. If the desired location for the ATM is within our service area (GARLAND, POULASKI and SALIN counties), just contact us and we’ll schedule a free consultation at your location. If your premises have adequate foot traffic and passes our basic Safety & Security guidelines, we can have an ATM installed and ready to operate within 10 business days. Please call (501) 413-7868 to set up an appointment!</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>ATM</li>
                                <li>ATM Cash Loading</li>
                                <li>ATM Maintenance &amp; Servicing</li>
                                <li>ATM Lighting (if required)</li>
                                <li>Live Transaction Tracking Account</li>
                                <li>Google Map ATM Location Markers</li>
                            </ul>

                <h4>Are there minimum transaction volume requirements to qualify for an ATM or get paid a profit share?</h4>

                <p>The answer to this question is an emphatic NO! We do not require any of our vendors to have a minimum number of transactions in order to have an ATM. This works out perfectly for some of our clients who don’t expect heavy traffic all the time. Our goal is obviously to place Dark Blue ATMs in the highest traffic areas possible. However, not all of our locations have a large number of transactions, nor do we expect this all of the time. We are completely capable and willing to cater to low transaction volume businesses and locations. If your business needs an ATM and you don’t expect the ATM to get transactions every day that is perfectly fine and we are willing to work with you. We also do not require a minimum number of transactions in order to get paid your profit share. Whether you get 1 transaction or 1000 you will always get paid your profit share as stipulated in your Dark Blue ATM Agreement.</p>
