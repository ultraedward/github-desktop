                <h4>What are the main reasons I could benefit from Dark Blue
                LLC?</h4>
            </li>
            <li>
                <img class="atm" src="img/atm.png">
            Zero Investment – 100% Profit: The first thing most businesses
            consider in any decision is the associated cost, so you’ll be
            pleased to know that we do not require any payment of any kind and
            will never ask a business owner for a single cent for any of our
            standard services. That means that it will never cost a business
            owner money to have an Dark Blue ATM set up and operate at any
            location. Businesses that use Dark Blue LLC get a profit share
            starting at 25% per transaction and increasing from there,
            depending on the level of traffic your business location generates.
            Unlike most ATM companies, who have a static profit share that does
            not take into account the traffic of your location, we reward
            businesses that have a greater level of traffic with a higher
            profit share rate.</li>
            <li>Increase Traffic to Your Business or Location: We have a focus
            on the “internet of things” and social media to generate business.
            We use a wide variety of advertising platforms at our expense to
            drive customers to our ATM machines, which, in turn, will drive
            customers to your business. For instance, using Google Maps, we set
            up a location for each ATM machine which helps customers locate our
            machines. This means that people (with cash!) are going to be
            coming to YOUR business who would not otherwise do so, increasing
            your company’s local awareness and customer base. In addition, we
            use avenues such as Facebook, YouTube and many more to promote our
            Dark Blue ATMs. This drives even MORE traffic to your
            business.</li>
            <li>Complimentary Receipt Couponing: ATM receipts with coupons can
            not only pay back a customer’s surcharge with savings on products
            you carry, they’re also a great way to drive sales! This service
            creates a truly synergistic relationship between our ATM and your
            business. For every receipt that prints out we allow your business
            to advertise promotions, special events and more. This generates
            more on-site business for your establishment, rewards the use of
            our ATMs which drives customers back to your business, and creates
            greater customer awareness and loyalty at your business.</li>
            <li>Expert Service: Our ATM machines are serviced and loaded by
            trained professionals that inspect each ATM on a regular basis to
            ensure perfect function and constantly available funds. This
            guarantees that not only the new customers you will receive from
            operating a Dark Blue ATM always have access to cash, but that our
            business represents your business in only the most professional
            fashion.</li>
            <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                <h4>Are there any monthly charges or hidden monthly fees for my
                new ATM?</h4>
            </li>
            <li>Absolutely not. All aspects of Dark Blue basic services are
            provided absolutely free of charge. There is no charge for setting
            up, operating or advertising with any ATM machines on any
            businesses property.</li>
            <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                <h4>How do I load my ATM?</h4>
            </li>
            <li>Any business that has an Dark Blue ATM will not be expected to
            handle the process of loading any ATM. Each Dark Blue ATM is loaded
            by a trained professional on a regular basis. This saves you the
            time and hassle of guaranteeing your machine has available funds.
            We also have another plan for those businesses that they want to
            load the DARK Blue ATM machines by themselves.</li>
            <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                <h4>How much revenue can I expect to generate from an ATM
                placement?</h4>
            </li>
            <li>The Profit Margin on setting up an Dark Blue ATM is 100%. Since
            there is no cost to set up an Dark Blue ATM, any business that has
            one of our machines on their premises can expect pure profit with
            zero investment.</li>
            <li>The Raw Numbers are pretty concrete. Statistically, if an ATM
            is located inside of a business, the number of customers that enter
            that business in a day is the number of transactions that can be
            expected per month. This means if 150 customers enter your business
            in a day and each transaction is $3.00, after the network fee we
            pay, you can expect to make nearly $2,000 annually with our
            starting 25% rate. If an ATM is placed outside of your business,
            the amount of money you make annually can rise exponentially
            depending on the location of your establishment and where outside
            of your business the ATM is placed.</li>

                <h4>How secure are ATM Machines from robbery – Is my business
                safe?</h4>
            </li>
            <li>The Likelihood of an ATM crime occurring is very small.
            According to the POP Center (Problem Oriented Policing –
            www.popcenter.com), estimates for the percentage of ATM crimes are
            derived from periodic surveys of banks conducted by banking
            associations. According to those surveys, there was an estimated
            one ATM crime (including robbery) per 3.5 million transactions.
            This means that there is a 0.00000286% chance of an ATM crime
            occurring at any given location in the United States.</li>

                <h4>Whose is responsible for machine repairs and regular
                maintenance?</h4>
            </li>
            <li>Dark Blue LLC handles all maintenance and repairs to our
            machines at absolutely no cost to the business or location owner.
            We use only the most professional service providers when doing so.
            We keep our machines clean and attractive, because we know how
            important presentation is to your business, and ours.</li>

                <h4>What are the requirements to qualify for free ATM machine
                placement?</h4>
            </li>
            <li>Qualifying for one of our ATM machines to be placed at your
            location is very simple. If the desired location for the ATM is
            within our service area (GARLAND, POULASKI and SALIN counties),
            just contact us and we’ll schedule a free consultation at your
            location. If your premises have adequate foot traffic and passes
            our basic Safety & Security guidelines, we can have an ATM
            installed and ready to operate within 10 business days. Please call

                <h4>Are there minimum transaction volume requirements to
                qualify for an ATM or get paid a profit share?</h4>
                <p>The answer to this question is an emphatic NO! We do not
                require any of our vendors to have a minimum number of
                transactions in order to have an ATM. This works out perfectly
                for some of our clients who don’t expect heavy traffic all the
                time. Our goal is obviously to place Dark Blue ATMs in the
                highest traffic areas possible. However, not all of our
                locations have a large number of transactions, nor do we expect
                this all of the time. We are completely capable and willing to
                cater to low transaction volume businesses and locations. If
                your business needs an ATM and you don’t expect the ATM to get
                transactions every day that is perfectly fine and we are
                willing to work with you. We also do not require a minimum
                number of transactions in order to get paid your profit share.
                Whether you get 1 transaction or 1000 you will always get paid
                your profit share as stipulated in your Dark Blue ATM
                Agreement.</p>
